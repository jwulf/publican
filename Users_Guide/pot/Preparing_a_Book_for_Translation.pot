msgid "Complete the XML of a document."
msgstr ""

msgid "The XML for this version of the document should now be considered ‘frozen’. If your document is stored in a version-controlled repository, you should now move this version into a separate directory or branch. This allows writers to begin work on subsequent versions of the document in one branch, while providing a stable base for translation in another branch."

msgid "<prompt>$</prompt> <command>publican trans_drop</command>"

msgid "<application>Publican</application> creates a new subdirectory, named <filename>trans_drop/</filename>. The <filename>trans_drop/</filename> subdirectory contains a snapshot of the source files of the document.

msgid "<application>Publican</application> generates a POT file for every XML file in the XML directory, whether the XML file is used in the document or not.
