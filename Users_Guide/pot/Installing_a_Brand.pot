msgid "Installing a brand"

msgid "<application>Publican</application> brands for Fedora, Genome, and oVirt documents are available as RPM packages in Fedora. Similarly, Red Hat internally distributes RPM packages containing <application>Publican</application> brands for GIMP, JBoss, and Red Hat documents. Providing that you have access to the relevant repositories, you can install these brands on a computer that runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Fedora — or an operating system derived from either — with the command <command>yum install publican-<replaceable>brand</replaceable></command> or with a graphical package manager such as <application>PackageKit</application>."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you use <application>Publican</application> on an operating system that does not use RPM packages, your documentation project might provide its brand in another format. Whatever the format in which the brand is supplied, you must place the brand files in a subdirectory of the <application>Publican</application> <filename>Common_Content</filename> directory. By default, this directory is located at <filename>/usr/share/publican/Common_Content</filename> on Linux operating systems and at <filename>%SystemDrive%/%ProgramFiles%/Publican/Common_Content</filename> on Windows operating systems — typically, <filename>C:/Program Files/Publican/Common_Content</filename>"

The CC0 license allows you to redistribute and relicense the files that make up the common brand (including the CSS and image files) to suit your project. <application>Publican</application> suggests the GFDL for documentation by default because <application>Publican</application> is developed primarily to build documentation for software. The GFDL is compatible with the GPL, which is the most commonly used license for open-source software."
