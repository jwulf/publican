msgid "The only part of the XML language tag that is mandatory in <application>Publican</application> is the <firstterm>language subtag</firstterm>.

In many languages, spelling and vocabulary vary significantly from region to region.

msgid "The language subtag comprises two or more lower-case letters and is the only mandatory part of the language tag. For most widely spoken languages, the language subtag is a two-letter code identical with the language codes specified in ISO 639-1, <footnote> <para> <link xlink:href=\"http://www.infoterm.info/standardization/iso_639_1_2002.php\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">http://www.infoterm.info/standardization/iso_639_1_2002.php</link> </para> </footnote> for example, <literal>zh</literal> (Chinese), <literal>hi</literal> (Hindi), <literal>es</literal> (Spanish), and <literal>en</literal> (English). Where no two-letter code exists in ISO 639-1, the language subtag is usually a three-letter code identical with the codes specified in ISO 639-2,<footnote> <para> <link xlink:href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/</link> </para> </footnote> for example, <literal>bal</literal> (Balochi), <literal>apk</literal> (Kiowa Apache), and <literal>tpi</literal> (Tok Pisin). Finally, a small number of language subtags appear in the IANA registry that have no ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 equivalent, such as subtags for the constructed languages <literal>qya</literal> (Quenya) and <literal>tlh</literal> (Klingon), and for the occult language <literal>i-enochian</literal> (Enochian). This last example also illustrates a small number of language subtags <firstterm>grandfathered</firstterm> into the registry that do not match the two-letter or three-letter pattern of codes derived from the ISO 639 standards."

Extended language subtags are three-letter codes that represent languages that share a close relationship with a language already represented by a language subtag. For example, <literal>yue</literal> represents Cantonese, but this subtag must always be used with the language subtag associated with it (Chinese), thus: <literal>zh-yue</literal>. The IETF does not yet recognize RFC 5646 as \"Best Common Practice\", nor are these subtags part of the XML standard yet."

msgid "The script subtag comprises four letters — the first one in upper case, the other three in lower case — and defines a writing system.

For example, <literal>sr-Latn</literal> represents Serbian written with the Latin alphabet and <literal>sr-Cyrl</literal> represents Serbian written with the Cyrillic alphabet; <literal>az-Arab</literal> represents Azerbaijani written in Arabic script and <literal>az-Cyrl</literal> represents Azerbaijani written with the Cyrillic alphabet. Conversely, French should not be represented as <literal>fr-Latn</literal>, because French is not commonly written in any script other than the Latin alphabet anywhere in the world."

msgid "variant subtag"
msgstr ""

msgid "Variant subtags identify well-defined, recognizable variants of a language or script and can include upper-case letters, lower-case letters, and numerals. Variant subtags that start with a letter must be at least five characters long, and those that start with a numeral must be at least four characters long. Most variant subtags can only be used in combination with specific subtags or combinations of subtags. Variant subtags do not harmonize with any other standard; they are each the result of a separate registration with the IETF by an interested person or group."
msgstr ""

msgid "Under the present standard, dialects of several languages are designated with variant subtags, for example, <literal>nedis</literal> denotes Nadiza (also known as Natisone), a dialect of Slovenian. This tag must be used in conjunction with the language subtag for Slovenian, thus: <literal>sl-nedis</literal>. In September 2009, the IETF issued a Request for Comments (RFC) that (amongst other things) proposes that dialects be represented by language extension subtags attached to language subtags.<footnote> <para> <link xlink:href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646</link> </para> </footnote>"

msgid "Most variant subtags mark a particular orthography, most usually as a result of an official spelling reform or a significant work documenting the language. Examples (with their required language subtags) include: <literal>fr-1606nicot</literal> (French as documented by Jean Nicot in 1606), <literal>de-1901</literal> (German spelling codified by the 2nd Orthographic Conference in 1901) and <literal>be-1959acad</literal> (Belarusian as codified by the Orthography Commission in 1959)."

msgid "Finally, some variant subtags denote a particular variant of a system of writing or transliteration. For example, <literal>zh-Latn-wadegile</literal> is Chinese written in the Latin alphabet, according to the transliteration system developed by Thomas Wade and Herbert Giles; <literal>ja-Latn-hepburn</literal> is Japanese written in the Latin alphabet using the transliteration system of James Curtis Hepburn."
