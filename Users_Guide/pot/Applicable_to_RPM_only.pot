msgid "This section discusses packaging documents for distribution through the <application>RPM Package Manager</application>. However, when you use the <prompt>$</prompt> <command>publican package</command> command, <application>Publican</application> generates a tarball that you can use to build a package to distribute through different package manager software. If you run <command>publican package</command> on a computer on which <application>rpmbuild</application> is not installed, <application>Publican</application> still generates the tarball, even though it cannot then generate an RPM package from that tarball."
