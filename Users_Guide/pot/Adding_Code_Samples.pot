msgid "Note the <tag>&lt;area&gt;</tag> elements that define the position of the callouts that will appear on the code sample. The <literal>coords</literal> attributes specify a line number and a column number separated by a space. In this example, callouts are applied to lines 4 and 12 of the code, lined up with each other in column 75. Although this approach means that you might have to adjust <literal>coords</literal> attributes if you ever modify the code to which they apply, it avoids mixing XML <tag>&lt;coords&gt;</tag> tags into the code itself."
