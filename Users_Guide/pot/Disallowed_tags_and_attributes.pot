msgid "Not every <firstterm>element</firstterm> (tag) and attribute that works with <application>Publican</application> is <firstterm>supported</firstterm>. Specifically, not every tag has been tested with regards its effect on the presentation of a document once it has been built in HTML or PDF."
msgstr ""

msgid "<application>Publican</application> works with almost all DocBook elements and their attributes, and most of these elements are <firstterm>supported</firstterm>. Supported elements and attributes are those whose presentation in <application>Publican</application> HTML and PDF output has been tested and is of an acceptable quality."
msgstr ""

msgid "Other elements and attributes that are not known to be harmful or redundant but which have not been tested for quality are <firstterm>unsupported</firstterm>. If material within a particular DocBook tag does not look correct when you build a document in HTML or PDF, the problem could be that the transformation logic for that tag has not yet been tested. Build the document again and examine <application>Publican</application>'s output as the document builds. <application>Publican</application> presents warnings about unsupported tags that it encounters in your XML files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally, a small group of elements and attributes are <firstterm>discouraged</firstterm>. These elements and attributes are set out below, each accompanied by rationale explaining why it is discouraged."

msgid "<tag>&lt;inlinegraphic&gt;</tag>"
msgstr ""

msgid "This element presents information as a graphic rather than as text and does not provide an option to present a text alternative to the graphic. This tag therefore hides information from people with visual impairments. In jurisdictions that have legal requirements for electronic content to be accessible to people with visual impairments, documents that use this tag will not satisfy those requirements. Section 508 of the <citetitle>Rehabilitation Act of 1973</citetitle><footnote> <para> Refer to <link xlink:href=\"http://www.section508.gov/\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">http://www.section508.gov/</link> </para> </footnote> is an example of such a requirement for federal agencies in the United States."

msgstr ""

msgid "The <tag>&lt;olink&gt;</tag> tag provides cross-references between XML documents. For <tag>&lt;olink&gt;</tag>s to work outside of documents that are all hosted within the same library of XML files, you must provide a URL for the document to which you are linking. In environments that use <tag>&lt;olink&gt;</tag>s, these URLs can be supplied either as an XML entity or with a server-side script. <application>Publican</application> does not provide any way to build or use a database for these links."

msgid "<tag>&lt;[element] xreflabel=\"[any_string_here]\"&gt;</tag>"
msgstr ""

msgid "The presence of an <tag>&lt;xreflabel&gt;</tag> attribute reduces the usability of printed versions of a book. As well, attribute values are not seen by translators and, consequently, cannot be translated."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, if you have the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"&lt;chapter id=\"ch03\" xreflabel=\"Chapter Three\"&gt;\n"
"	&lt;title&gt;The Secret to Eternal Life&lt;/title&gt;\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "when your XML is built to HTML, the <tag>&lt;xref&gt;</tag> tag becomes an HTML anchor tag as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "…see &lt;a href=\"#ch03\"&gt;Chapter Three&lt;/a&gt; for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "The text contained by the anchor tag is the same as the data in the <tag>&lt;xreflabel&gt;</tag> attribute. In this case, it means that readers of printed copies have less information available to them."
msgstr ""

msgid "You could work around this if you make the value of the <tag>&lt;xreflabel&gt;</tag> attribute the same as the text within the <tag>&lt;title&gt;</tag><tag>&lt;/title&gt;</tag> element tags. However, this duplication increases the risk of typo-level errors and otherwise offers no underlying improvement. And it still reduces the amount of information presented to readers of printed copies."

"[more deathless prose here]     \n"

msgid "Will result in an HTML anchor tag as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "…see &lt;a href=\"#ch03\"&gt;The Secret to Eternal Life&lt;/a&gt; for details."

msgid "This isn't as informative as the text presented to a reader if you do not use an <tag>&lt;xreflabel&gt;</tag> attribute. The following:"

msgstr ""

msgid "…see &lt;a href=\"#ch03\"&gt;Chapter 3: The Secret to Eternal Life&lt;/a&gt; for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "More important, however, are the translation problems that <tag>&lt;xreflabel&gt;</tag> tags cause. Attribute values are not seen by translators. Consequently, they are not translated. Consider the second example above again:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If the <tag>&lt;xreflabel&gt;</tag> attribute is not used, the title and chapter indicator, both properly translated, appear to the reader. That is, the following:"

msgstr ""

msgid "…Sehen Sie &lt;a href=\"#ch03\"&gt;Kapitel 3: Das Geheimnis des ewigen Lebens&lt;/a&gt; für Details."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is, not surprisingly, what we want."
msgstr ""

msgid "The <parameter>xreflabel</parameter> attribute is therefore discouraged."
msgstr ""

msgid "<tag>&lt;[element] endterm=\"[any_string_here]\"&gt;</tag>"
msgstr ""

msgid "The <parameter>endterm</parameter> attribute allows you to present hyperlinked text other than the name of the section or chapter to which the hyperlink points. As such, it decreases the usability of printed versions of documents, and causes difficulty for translators."
msgstr ""

msgid "The text presented in an element (such as an <tag>&lt;xref&gt;</tag>) that contains the <parameter>endterm</parameter> attribute is taken from a <tag>&lt;titleabbrev&gt;</tag> tag in the target chapter or section. Although the content of the <tag>&lt;titleabbrev&gt;</tag> tag is available to translators in the document's PO files, it is removed from the context of the <tag>&lt;xref&gt;</tag>. The absence of this context makes reliable translation impossible in languages that mark prepositions or articles for grammatical number and grammatical gender."
