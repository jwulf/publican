	 <para>
		To install a document on a website that you are building manually, change into the directory that contains the source for the document and run:
	</para>
	
<screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>publican build --embedtoc --formats=<replaceable>list_of_formats</replaceable> --langs=<replaceable>language_codes</replaceable> --publish</command> 
<prompt>$</prompt> <command>publican install_book --site_config <replaceable>path_to_site_configuration_file</replaceable>.cfg --lang <replaceable>language_code</replaceable></command></screen>
	 <para>
		Note that you can run a single <prompt>$</prompt> <command>publican build</command> command for all languages that you want to publish, but must run a separate <command>publican install_book</command> for each language. You must include <literal>html</literal> as one of the formats in the <command>publican build</command> command; optionally, include any or all of the following formats in a comma-separated list: <literal>html-single</literal>, <literal>pdf</literal>, and <literal>epub</literal>.
	</para>
	 <para>
		To update a document, change into the directory that contains the updated source for the document and run the same commands as if you were installing the document for the first time. <application>Publican</application> replaces the old version with the new version.
	</para>
	 <para>
		To remove a document, change into the directory that contains the source for the document and run:
	</para>
	
<screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>publican remove_book --site_config <replaceable>path_to_site_configuration_file</replaceable>.cfg --lang <replaceable>language_code</replaceable></command></screen>
	 <para>
		When you have installed the documents, the website is ready to upload to your webserver by whatever process you usually use, for example <application>scp</application>, <application>rsync</application>, or an FTP client.
